        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, we were tasked with investigating a public interface and 
            interviewing users for their experiences. I chose to evaluate the printing process (pictured to the right) using
            the printer stations in the Brown University Sciences Library (SciLi). Below, I will go through
            the different parts of the process it took to create and storyboard personas based on user research.

        <h2>Description and Annotated Sketch</h2>
        <p>
            To the right, I have annotated the key components of the Sci-Li printer station. This printer station includes a card swipe
            to allow Brown students to access their uploaded documents. It also includes a computer monitor, keyboard, mouse, written instructions
            on how to operate the printer, a label identifying the printer, and the printer itself. Once students upload their documents from their own devices, they can 
            access them using these printer stations.

        <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Where do you start when using the printer?</li>
          <li>How long does it take on average to print something?</li>
          <li>What components of the printer station do you use?</li>
          <li>How was your experience using the written instructions?</li>
          <li>How does the experience of printing compare to others you have used?</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="obs">
      <div id="text-obs">
        <h3>Observations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Users who printed from their phone had to go through many steps on the website (emailing the document, saving the file, loading the 
            desktop version of the webpage, zooming in to see the required buttons, and uploading the file)</li>
          <li>Users had to switch from "Tablet Mode" to "Desktop Mode" to find the button to upload their document on their phone</li>
          <li>Users took more time figuring out how to send their document to the printer than actually printing</li>
          <li>Users often were in a rushed state when printing, so it was easiest for them to use their phone</li>
          <li>Users didn't consult the written signs and instructions around the printer until after they had already sent their document to print</li>
          </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row" id="summary">
      <div id="text-obs">
        <h3>Interview Summaries</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Users who used the mobile website necessary to send documents to the printer station took more time when printing as there were more steps necessary to understand how to print.</li>
          <li>Users didnâ€™t consult the written labels or instructions on or around the printer station despite its purpose of being there to be helpful resources. </li>
          <li>Users tended to have a comparable experience with the Sci-Li printer compared to other printers as they enjoyed not having to operate the hardware of the printer. </li>
          <li>The printing process takes between 2 to 5 minutes where desktop users tend to take less time and mobile users tend to take more. Mobile users appeared to be more frantic and mentioned being in a rush in scenarios when it is necessary to use the Sci-Li printers.</li>

        <h2>Difference in Mobile and Web User Experience</h2>
        <p>
           One major finding through my interviews was that the user experience drastically differed between Mobile and Web users for the online uploading website necessary to print.
           Below are the differences in the mobile (first two photos) and web (last photo from the left) websites.

        <p>
            I made an empathy map for "Late Larry", a student who is constantly late. This student needs to make sure that the printing process is fast and efficient.

            I made an empathy map for "Freshman Frannie", a student who is new to Brown and also dislikes handling complex technology. This student needs to make sure that the printing process is understandable and easy to learn.
