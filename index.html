        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, we were tasked with investigating a public interface and 
            interviewing users for their experiences. I chose to evaluate the printing process (pictured to the right) using
            the printer stations in the Brown University Sciences Library (SciLi). Below, I will go through
            the different parts of the process it took to create and storyboard personas based on user research.

        <h2>Description and Annotated Sketch</h2>
        <p>
            To the right, I have annotated the key components of the Sci-Li printer station. This printer station includes a card swipe
            to allow Brown students to access their uploaded documents. It also includes a computer monitor, keyboard, mouse, written instructions
            on how to operate the printer, a label identifying the printer, and the printer itself. Once students upload their documents from their own devices, they can 
            access them using these printer stations.

        <h2>Interview Questions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Where do you start when using the printer?</li>
          <li>How long does it take on average to print something?</li>
          <li>What components of the printer station do you use?</li>
          <li>How was your experience using the written instructions?</li>
          <li>How does the experience of printing compare to others you have used?</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Observations from Interviews</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User One:</strong> This user expressed difficulty with printing previously from their 
            desktop so decided to use the mobile website to send documents to the printer. The process of preparing a 
            document on mobile required numerous steps for the user: emailing the document, saving the file, loading the 
            desktop version of the webpage, zooming in to see the required buttons, and uploading the file. Once sending the file, 
            the user spent time navigating to the correct printer by having to find the correct printer labels. The user proceeded to 
            interact with the card swipe and computer monitor to retrieve the document. Retrieving the document from the printer took less 
            time than preparing the document to print and finding the correct printer.</li>
            <li><strong>User Two:</strong> This user similarly had to undergo many steps on the mobile webpage to upload a document to print. But, they were familiar with finding the desktop version of the webpage. They expressed that they often would try to print in a rushed state as they would be running late to various commitments. Once sending the document, the user ignored the other components (physical and written) of the printer and used the card swipe and monitor. They pointed out that the placement of the keyboard and card swipe was a bit awkward, as well as had difficulty working the card swipe with their ID.  Overall, the user expressed how this process reduced worry of understanding the hardware of the printer.</li>
            <li><strong>User Three:</strong> This user already had their laptop out and decided to upload their document on it. The user expressed comfort and ease with uploading a document and printing from the printer station. When approaching the printer station, they only interacted with the card swipe and mouse. They didn’t interact with the written instructions or labels. When receiving their documents, they realized they were printed in black and white rather than color. Overall, they expressed enjoyment in using the printer station as they noted in the past it was reliable at having enough ink and paper, as well as not physically malfunctioning.

        <h2>Interview Summaries</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Users who used the mobile website necessary to send documents to the printer station took more time when printing as there were more steps necessary to understand how to print.</li>
          <li>Users didn’t consult the written labels or instructions on or around the printer station despite its purpose of being there to be helpful resources. </li>
          <li>Users tended to have a comparable experience with the Sci-Li printer compared to other printers as they enjoyed not having to operate the hardware of the printer. </li>
          <li>The printing process takes between 2 to 5 minutes where desktop users tend to take less time and mobile users tend to take more. Mobile users appeared to be more frantic and mentioned being in a rush in scenarios when it is necessary to use the Sci-Li printers.</li>

        <h2>Difference in Mobile and Web User Experience</h2>
        <p>
           One major finding through my interviews was that the user experience drastically differed between Mobile and Web users for the online uploading website necessary to print.
           Below are the differences in the mobile (first two photos) and web (last photo from the left) websites.

        <h2>Empathy Map 1</h2>
        <p>
            I made an empathy map for "Late Larry", a student who is constantly late. This student needs to make sure that the printing process is fast and efficient.

        <h2>Empathy Map 2</h2>
        <p>
            I made an empathy map for "Freshman Frannie", a student who is new to Brown and also dislikes handling complex technology. This student needs to make sure that the printing process is understandable and easy to learn.

           Here is a storyboard representing "Late Larry's" journey to try and print out his homework before he is late.
